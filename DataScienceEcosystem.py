# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:** I have learned data science task categories, what those tasks support, took a deeper look at tools from code asset management tools to management tools, learned what the popular languages are and their details, library names and their usage, APIs, Datasets and Models, Jupyter, The Anaconda, R, RStudio and their tools and finally Git and GitHub.   
# - Phyton 
# - R
# - SQL
# - Java
# - Scala

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. Java

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. NumPy
# 2. Pandas
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. TensorFlow

# ### Data Science Tools
# * Jupyter Notebook
# * RStudio
# * PyCharm

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
